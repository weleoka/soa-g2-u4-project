# Scheduler project

This project will continue upon the greatness accomplished in the 3rd assignment of the course.
We will use the same microservice-esque approach and the same tech as in the other services.

- Back-end
  - Spring framework
  - Java 11
  - Docker containers
 - Front-end
  - Vue.js 3
  - Docker / NGINX

We will also implement a message que using Kafka.
