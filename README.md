# Scheduler project

This project will continue upon the greatness accomplished in the 3rd assignment of the course.
We will use the same microservice-esque approach and the same tech as in the other services.

- Back-end
  - Spring framework
  - Java 11
  - Docker containers
 - Front-end
    - Vue.js 3
    - NginX http hosting
    - NginX reverse proxy

We will also implement a message queue using (Kafka/RabbitMQ? not decided...).

## Auth
This project is never deployed in production, but for development it may be necessary to use your Canvas user ID and Canvas access token in the web application. Set the environment variables where the app is hosted or where webpack compiles the source.

```
export VUE_APP_CANVAS_TOKEN="badbadbadadsf234234acsfvsdf"
export VUE_APP_CANVAS_USER="651234"
```

This is of course completely unacceptable in production when the architecture would be in place for OAuth and authentication and identity providing services.


## The build process for Spring Boot services/apps
Services can be built using `/soa-g2-xx-service/docker_build.sh`, which is recommended. It can also be done with docker-compose, by uncommenting the relevant build service in `docker_compose.yml`, but then using the command `UID=${UID} GID=${GID} docker-compose up --no-deps student-service-builder`. You may have an issue with UID being a read-only variable in bash. 

To always run the build process with docker-compose and then afterwards starting the JRE container is not practical as the build process takes so long to return.

Todo: currently each project has it's own local copy of the gradle build cache... If would be awesome if that was instead kept in one place as the dependencies between the projects are almost identical.

Optionally to build all the servies you can use this repo's script `build_spring_projects.sh`.


## Running individual Services with Gradle
Because the services are multi-module gradle projects run a service using `./gradlew :service:bootRun` for example. The ports for eached spawened Tomcat are not conflicting. See `docker-compose.yml` or `application.yml` or `stdout` for details of each services's port.


### Spring Boot services API's
You can find API documentation generated by Swagger at for example: `http://localhost:8086/swagger-ui/index.html` and then `/v3/api-docs` in path input field. Or simply go to URL `http://localhost:8082/v3/api-docs` for the raw version.


### Networks
Due to some machines running VPN or other docker networks it is safest to create an independent subnet for this project. Before running docker-compose up make sure that the network exists on your host machine, which is what the command `docker network create g2s-net-1 --subnet 172.24.24.0/24` does.


## Docker and Cgroups
As the move to cgroups v2 isn't complete on many distros at time of writing December 2020 there may be an error when launching docker containers. Here's a workaround for now, but come end-January 2021 it sould be back to normal I imgagine.

```
sudo mkdir /sys/fs/cgroup/systemd
sudo mount -t cgroup -o none,name=systemd cgroup /sys/fs/cgroup/systemd
```
